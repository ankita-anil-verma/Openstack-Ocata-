# Openstack-Ocata-
OpenStack is a complex open source project. 
It moves forward with a set of scheduled major releases which are labelled alphabetically. 
Ocata cleaned up many of these issues, and one result was the understanding that ease of use needed improvement, 
both in user interfaces and APIs. The focus now is on improving the user interfaces and APIs for modules, 
and extending manageability in most of the project areas over the next three OpenStack releases. 
These are both crucial efforts to allow scale-out deployment and move OpenStack into mainstream acceptance.
